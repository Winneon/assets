		<strong>### THIS NARRATION OF SORTS IS HIGHLY NSFW AND WILL BE SHOWING NSFL AND HORROR-ESQUE IMAGES. THE MORALES OF THIS EROGE ARE ALSO MASSIVELY NOT RIGHT. PROCEED WITH CAUTION. ###
		### THIS NARRATION INCLUDES MASSIVE SPOILERS FOR THE ENTIRETY OF SAYA NO UTA. ###</strong>

		Welp, here we go. I'm going to try this talking thing whilst playing and seeing how well it goes. I'm going into this horror eroge completely blind. A lot of things won't make sense because I'm taking them out of context and I'm not posting eevery CG or text box on the screen. The majority of this will be typed at long intervals, so some images or comments from me will be 10 to 20 minutes apart, or even more.

		This is in NO way professional. My reactions are over the top 50% of the time, and I can get pretty repetetive. These are just my honest reactions to some scenes found in this eroge.

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/ycgoLm8.png" id="image3">
		what the fuck

		I was prepared for these kind of things, but my god the last 5 CGs...

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/FPmR0XH.png" id="image3">
		ok

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/rdyIZ7Q.png" id="image4">

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/l29DixB.png" id="image5">
		So this is what it looks like in everyone else's eyes, while the previous scene from Funimori's point of view.

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/o6xM7BD.png" id="image6">

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/MTElYiA.png" id="image7">

		she looks like a loli even though she's probably somewhere in her latter teens...

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/V4nLRGw.png" id="image10">
		that foreshadowing

		This music is way too eerie. I can't eat my chips like this ;_;

		OMFG WOW OK

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/ZfWX6Js.png" id="image11">
		aren't we starting a wee bit too early?

		talk about cringeworthy

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/t68v7o0.png" id="image12">
		that's totally not a photographed image with tons of photoshop filters on it...

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/BuN4uIh.png" id="image13">
		are you an idiot?

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/F2Jfe6k.png" id="image14">
		And here's the exact scene above but from Funimori's eyes.

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/mgYJVsU.png" id="image15">

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/maDELMn.png" id="image16">
		damn

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/nMgHFLy.png" id="image17">

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/8qwixaI.png" id="image18">

		I know he's been going through something really extensive and traumatic, but holy fuck he's cruel.

		I'm guessing Funimori is going to attempt to kill one of his friends soon.

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/CfWOCZG.png" id="image19">
		i redract my statements 2 lines ago

		looks like we're going into flashback mode now

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/8Mqg6bO.png" id="image20">
		want a medal?

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/FMxwQGD.png" id="image21">

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/n86CxdZ.png" id="image22">
		She's supposed to be drawn cutely, but I would be lying if I didn't say she was the creepiest character in this whole thing so far.

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/Diuvnd0.png" id="image23">

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/4kPJZyt.png" id="image24">
		we got batman up in this

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/OPMrHZu.png" id="image25">
		does she like not eat anything?...

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/QWtAYad.png" id="image26">
		I have a feeling she does more than just scare them...

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/ooAOF3A.png" id="image27">
		so those are bedsheets, huh

		and back to the present now

		oh god oh god oh god

		So Saya is actually the monster and Funimori's condition makes it look like Saya is human and everyone else is the monster. That new info made some previous scenes... pretty disgusting.

		this fucking music

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/XTjXUqW.png" id="image28">
		what the fuck Saya

		and Omi is dead. Saya is a horror-esque monster. what the hell is wrong this this eroge

		AND SAYA EATS THE PEOPLE SHE KILLS
		DAMN

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/BXEvjA4.png" id="image29">
		Fun fact. The stuff Saya is eating is actually Omi. Just imagine Saya as the horror-esque imagery and everything else (like the walls and the green slime) as normal scenery.

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/P0TBf1G.png" id="image30">
		WHAT THE FUCK FUNIMORI IS EATING IT NOW HES EATING HIS FRIEND

		this eroge is beyond fucked up

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/gsfA9IJ.png" id="image31">
		i cant fucking take this

		"I usually catch them in the nearby park."

		Funimori hasn't realised that he's eating his friend. I'm just waiting for his reaction when Saya takes him "hunting" together.

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/QPDsz9A.png" id="image32">
		oh?

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/eEQd3HR.png" id="image33">
		what is this, dora the explorer?

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/21MQzbc.png" id="image34">
		wow saya, you need to hold back on eating everything in sight

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/oHOVOXJ.png" id="image35">

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/pZ7kc4r.png" id="image37">
		this isn't going to end well

		and he's not going home...?

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/UY7CAhQ.png" id="image38">

		Apparently that place is where Saya's dad lived. So I guess Funimori found it after all.

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/hAQf3v8.png" id="image39">
		I'll pretend you didn't just say that.

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/fNhGnVd.png" id="image40">
		the hell?

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/p2kAzev.png" id="image41">
		this is going to escalate

		ugh this music is too eerie. gimme my guitars back

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/ZTGoBOx.png" id="image42">

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/V0rQY6t.png" id="image43">
		you HAD to say that.

		I kinda want to see Saya's actual form now since everything is hinting at is severely.

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/GlgeSGJ.png" id="image44">
		thanks for that

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/RLBD3CJ.png" id="image45">
		WHY WOULD YOU FUCKING ENTER A BATHROOM WITH BONES EVERYWHERE
		All of these characters are fucking idiots.

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/m07IXcf.png" id="image46">
		That darkness behind him is too quiet

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/nazrTj9.png" id="image47">
		called it

		and nothing interesting happened. oh well. at least i have my guitars back

		"nani sore????????"

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/36Ay2qh.png" id="image48">
		and things are getting fiesty again

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/TDLUpmt.png" id="image49">
		THANK YOU. ONE JAPANESE PERSON FINALLY HAS SOME SENSE.

		this scene would make an excellent doujinshi

		oh god saya why would you go to the neighbour's house

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/10F6kpH.png" id="image50">
		saya why

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/c2ULaFm.png" id="image51">
		Yes, I defintely wouldn't be scared by several slimy arms grabbing me from under a sofa.

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/Clyaa8L.png" id="image52">

		And now his friends are starting to take legal action. Or at least going to his medical therapist.

		Oh? Saya turned Yosuke (the neighbour) into another person will Funimori's condition somehow.

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/lSCb759.png" id="image53">

		yosuke thinks his family is the monster and he's going to kill them holy hell

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/cCm4CUY.png" id="image54">

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/K1u5EpW.png" id="image55">

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/BjzYns9.png" id="image56">
		the hell...

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/L1uGSEK.png" id="image57">
		now he's killing his child nonononono

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/QFwAr8L.png" id="image58">
		what in the fucking hell is wrong with this eroge

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/cmeyXdX.png" id="image59">
		And now he meets Saya in her human form. So apparently Saya has the ability to make others have Funimori's condition.

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/IH0d0jb.png" id="image60">
		let's like. NOT.

		wow he's fucking trying to rape her what the fuck

		that was off the charts.
		funimori gonna be mad

		FUNIMORI TO THE FUCKING RESCUE

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/SE6xNmV.png" id="image61">
		YEAH *screams internally*

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/G8BU2Nl.png" id="image62">

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/d1rQLeg.png" id="image63">

		So Saya has supernatural powers now?

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/YQkf5nZ.png" id="image64">
		why the fuck am I tearing up this is not even remotely emotional

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/ncO4P0Z.png" id="image65">

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/qhMDStz.png" id="image66">
		AND we have the first choice in this eroge.
		Either to revert Funimori's condition, which results in the world going back to normal, but Saya going back to looking like a monster.
		Or to keep the world as it is now, and to accept Funimori's condition with Saya keeping her human look.

		I'll be going with the first option because it sounds the most like a bad ending. Funimori is probably going to freak out when he discovers Saya is a monster after all.

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/Byrjgkw.png" id="image67">
		:(

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/Lf9Ozw2.png" id="image68">
		This is going to get emotional.

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/3ER0qev.png" id="image69">
		wow ok that escalated very quickly

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/23KZLLg.png" id="image70">
		I swear if they end it like this...

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/xmcXZBa.png" id="image71">

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/J3pLtjp.png" id="image72">

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/QSaHPOf.png" id="image73">
		Finally we're going to see Saya's actual appearance. (hopefully)

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/Q7Oernr.png" id="image95">
		WOW saya is full on jealous at Yoh

		ok I take it back it is a rape scene but if thats true than it can't be saya since she's a girl... so I guess there is another monster?

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/8M1eq6m.png" id="image96">

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/aMfaAls.png" id="image97">

		I seriously hope this eroge has at least one good ending.

		and koji is going into the basement. why even.

		nothing is in the basement. that was surprising.

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/FgGbqaL.png" id="image102">

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/vz9GSgT.png" id="image109">
		Except he did. He sent a voicemail to the therapist. Funimori, you're in for some trouble.

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/ixzSoRu.png" id="image110">
		don't tell me...

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/fiJC76I.png" id="image111">

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/cqOVC7B.png" id="image155">
		Another choice! Either to call Funimori or Ryoko.

		I'll go with Funimori because it sounds the most like a bad ending, considering he will probably die or something of the sort when he meets him.

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/egeqP7S.png" id="image156">

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/E6PwHLh.png" id="image157">

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/FPeEPYd.png" id="image158">

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/wQfAdIP.png" id="image159">
		He can't kill humans... unless they look like monsters, and then he's fine with it. So taking that into account, that means he said indirectly that he'd be able to kill Saya just fine if his condition disappeared. I'm going to guess that Saya isn't going to like that.

		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/HQGpzGA.png" id="image160">
		It's absolutely amazing how much he has changed since the beginning of this eroge.

		THAT's ALL FOLKS!

		SO AMAZING.

		This music is so good...

		Well, to wrap up thoughts on the entirety of this VN / eroge, I'm going to have to say it was on par with Grisaia no Kajitsu. The music was amazing, the story is very well put together, and the endings were all very satisfying. It's generally hard to find a bad ending satisfying, because they usually just get hacked together with no thought involved and they're usually just sudden that it's hard to get into them. Saya no Uta on the other hand was completely different in that sense. The first ending was by far my favourite ending. It was definetly more of a "bad" ending than the rest, although I can't really give any of the 3 endings in Saya no Uta a "good" or "bad" label. They were all bad endings in a sense.

		For my rating, I'll go with 9/10. It's definitly no wonder why Saya no Uta is one of the top rated VNs on VNDB. The story is just too good. Every transition was perfect, each ending was extremely satisfying, and I never once felt the need to stop reading. It grabbed me perfectly unlike any VN's I've ever played.

		As for my recomendation... not so much. Saya no Uta probably has the most fucked up morales I've ever seen in any form of media or literature whatsoever. There were 2 rape scenes, canaballism, and the fact that Saya turned Yoh into a sex slave. I probably won't ever recommend it to anyone unless they are fully prepared to play it. Swan Song will be my next VN, and it has the same amount of fucked up morales as Saya no Uta.

		Thank you for reading my narration / rant / extremely horrible LP!

		Aftertext: For those of you who want hear the ending music, here you go.

		The true ending (the second ending I got to) is called "Saya no Uta". (I don't like this one much personally.) <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcHt733Yin8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcHt733Yin8</a>

		The other 2 endings are called "Shoes of Glass" in English. (I personally like this one the most.) <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08sKNXcJXjg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08sKNXcJXjg</a>
