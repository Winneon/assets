### SWAN SONG IS AN EROGE CONTAINING A SOCIETY-COLLAPSING SCENARIO.  ###
### IF YOU HAVE TROUBLE HANDLING SEXUAL, VIOLENT, AND GORE IMAGERY,  ###
### THEN BY ALL MEANS, DO NOT CONTINUE. THIS NARRATION INCLUDES NSFL ###
### CONTENT AND MASSIVE SPOILERS FOR THE ENTIRETY OF SWAN SONG.      ###

Welcome to my Swan Song narrative. I will be playing Swan Song over the course of the next week, because there is no way in hell I'm going to be able to finish a 10-30 hour eroge all in one day. I was able to do that with Saya no Uta because it was 5-10 hours long (took me 9 hours), but not with this, and definitely not with my next eroge, which'll be the Muv-Luv saga.

The pace of this narrative will be very stagnant, just as it was with Saya no Uta. I'm going to try to refrain from posting screenshots every other second like I did with Saya no Uta, and try to do more talking this time around instead.

Please keep in mind that this narrative is /not/ supposed to be an LP (let's play). You most likely will not understand the story from just this narrative alone, and it is better to have the full experience by playing the eroge in the first place. If you want to know the story, go to a walkthrough or google it.

I'm going (almost) blind into Swan Song. The only thing I know about it is that the premise surrounds a society-collapsing scenario, and that Swan Song is an utsuge (Japanese jargon for depressing game). I hope y'all enjoy my honest reactions and how insane I can get with my mindset mid-game. Without furthur adieu, let's get this rolling!

### THE NARRATIVE STARTS HERE. ###

They misspelt "Prologue" on the title sequence (it said "Prologo"). It most likely is intentional though.

Starts on Christmas Eve. Which means everyone is probably in their homes as of this time.

The textbox is in the center this time. I've never played a VN / eroge before with the text box in the center of the screen, but not covering the entirety of the screen (NVL format).

There seems to be next to no music whatsoever in this eroge, and the eerie sounds in the background makes for a really tense situation (even though nothing significant has happened yet).

So the catastrophe is an earthquake. Sort of generic, but it makes the most sense.
The textbox is also shaking with the earthquake. The quality in this eroge...

#image2
Well, obviously. With buildings bending all over the place, it must be at least an 8.0 magnitude, probably even higher.

The textbox adjusts to how much text is in the box. Such QUALITY. Damn.

#image3
The text log is a wee bit glitchy, as shown.

So the town has been utterly destroyed, but there are literally no signs of people running about or screaming or etc.? What kind of town does the MC live in?!

Even the art looks amazing. This eroge has QUALITY.

#image4
He can't feel anything, but he can feels it when he washes something...

Where the hell are his parents? He's yet to mention them, although I have a feeling they're in the apartment and most likely dead.

And he left. With no mention of his parents. If he does have some sort of mentality left, then I think it's safe to assume that they weren't home.

#image5
So there /are/ people in the town. They just seem to be acting the same way as the MC is. It's surprising that there is practically no one running around frantically.

No voice actor for the MC, which is a shame.

#image6
heh?
I'm confused now.

WAIT.
WAIT.
THERE IS A VOICE ACTOR
FOR THE MC.
YES
YES

#image7
This eroge has fullscreen CGs, side CGs, and even mini CGs. Such QUALITY.
It's hard to express that enough, but the amount of quality in this eroge is on the scale of Front Wing's works (e.g. the Grisaia trilogy).

The MC is surprisingly calm in the midst of all this.

#image8
I hate to be abrupt, there is literally no chance in saving her at this point, MC.

#image9
yup.

The glowing white girl I showed a few screenshots up is repeating everything in a very high pitched voice. Her age certainly didn't look like a child though, so there must be something wrong with her psychologically.

#image10

A college student as an MC. That's certainly a nice change from the usual high-schooler.

So the glowing white girl (hereon shall be known as Aroe) basically has the IQ of a potato from my current point of view.

These voice actors have /serious/ talent.

#image11
Excuse me?

#image12

Good lord this eroge is /depressing/. Holy shit.

#image13
Right after she died too.

#image14
;_;

There aren't full sprites in this eroge. Instead, there are small windows that show up in the corners of the screen with the character in question's head in the window. That's certainly different from the usual.

Now we have a company of 6 people, including the MC and Aroe.

These characters are very calm... I don't understand why they are so.

#image15
best girl confirmed

>B-BAKA

I just realised the (lewd) girl on the cover of Swan Song is Aroe.

#image16
QUALITY
SUCH QUALITY

#image17
the tsundere is screaming

>Well, it can't be helped.
If I had a nickel for every time I saw or heard that sentence...

#image18
Damn. I wish I could be that composed in a situation like that.

Queue opening.

The opening is extremely ominous.

That opening was actually pretty good. If you want to see it, here's a link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVx_DSMiSt0

"Atto Primo Scena 1"
I guess the chapter names are misspelt intentionally. I'm pretty sure it's Latin, but don't trust my incomplete knowledge.

BACKGROUND MUSIC IS PLAYING
Finally. The prologue was ominous enough.

And just like that, the music is gone.

Looks like the school was burnt, specifically the gym. There goes that shelter option.

#image19
Finally someone asking the one question I've been asking all this time.

;__________;

#image20
Tanomura is awfully optimistic about the situation. Well, I don't blame him. It's completely understandable.

#image21
BEST

#image22
The hell?

OH. OH. She asked about MC-kun's parents.

The father is a famous composer... why am I not surprised.

>That's amazing!
>>It doesn't mean that I'm amazing...
>Of course not.
*chuckle*

>There are koalas and kangaroos in Austria, right?
I'm pretty sure you're missing an extra -lia at the end of that, with the first "i" missing.

#image23
BEST
BEST

Our little MC here doesn't have a single portion of a sense of humour.

#image24
See? Even best girl agrees with me.

#image25
Damn, no hesitation whatsoever.

#image26
Woah woah woah this conversation is spiraling out of control.

OHHHHH BUSTEEEDD

"Atto Primo Scena 2"

"Four days since the earthquake."
...Time shift much?

#image27
Another survivor!... I have a bad feeling about this.

#image28
;________;

>I'm not that sad that my wife and kid died. No, maybe I am. I don't know which...

This guy is just going on a rant about his life and the earthquake in an insane matter...

Good lord, he's not even allowing the MC to talk.

#image29
uh oh

>Getting rescued is stupid! Ahaha!

That... was just random.

#image30
Bad. Bad idea. You're probably going to get tons of frantic people there that are running about the place stealing stuff and other unspeakable things.

A boat to cross the lake?! If this was a real-life scenario, I'm pretty sure the boat would break halfway across the lake.

>I built rafts for fun as a kid. It's actually not that hard.
O-Okay.

#image31
Ouch.

>Girls don't understand these things.
HA.HA.HA.HA.

#image32
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I do not understand.

#image33
SMOOTH. SO SMOOTH.

New bg music track. Pianos.
Good lord this music wants to make me cry.

So MC (hereon shall be known as Tsukasa) met Yuka (the other woman) at a piano contest 10 years ago. 10. Years. Ago. Good lord these guys have good memory.

>I was an elementary student back then.
Which makes her probably about 18-21 years old.

Tsukasa lost right hand strength in a traffic accident when he was a piano prodigy...

"Atto Primo Scena 3"

We got some cheerful music up in this!

This guy has no hesitation whatsoever. Smooth as a baby.

#image34
And that, kids, is how you get fat.

#image35
And you're not young yourself?

#image36
OH. FIRST CHOICE.
Okay. Do not rest sounds more productive so I'll be going with that.

Yay time for happy fun times with a snowball fight and happy feelings.

Good lord, this line sounds so perfect: http://a.pomf.se/gawrsf.mp3
It's best girl Kawase saying "Urusai!~" or "Shut up!", but I can't stop pressing play over and over again ;_;

And the other girl (henceforth shall be known as Yukacchi) now has a fever. It'll totally get better. Right? RIGHT?!

>It's not a big deal.
It's a big deal when you're a main character of an utsuge, sweetie.

#image37
"Fever reducer"? Is that even a thing?

>It can't be helped.
That's two times now. I wonder if we can get to five by the time this eroge is over.

#image38
Her fever is worsening. Whad'ya know. I'm not even surprised.

#image30

#image40
For some reason, that restored statue looks like it has bulging veins from a capacitated arm.

#image41
DAMMMNN.

>I-If I have to, then I don't mind not being on TV...
Pfffffffffftttt hahahahaha

#image42
*drools from QUALITY*
And of course, Kawase (henceforth shall be known as Hibari) has to show how much of a tsundere she is by pointing her fingers everywhere.

She's even stuttering.

#image43
BREAKING THE FOURTH WALL HERE

Damn, this translation is filled with memes. I've seen "chibi" and "daijoubu" (I think) now.

I'm really loving the random slice of life moments in this eroge. With all the disaster and tragedy at every turn, it's nice to have a laughable and cozy scene every now and then. It does a really good job of lightening the mood, even if only lasts for a few minutes.

#image44
Oh? This'll be good.

And his "hint" is an envelope with anime characters written over it.

>But if I'm as dumb as rock, Hibari-chan and I are comrades.
>>Eh, what do you mean?
>>>I understand!
>>What, Kuwagata? I'll kill you if it's boring.
>>>I-It's probably alright.
>>Then go ahead.
>>>Okay. Tano-san is dumb as a rock. And Kawase-san swims like a stone. A rock and a stone. See, they're close. That's what you mean, right?
>>>>Oh, I see.
>>It's not, "I see", you b-BAKA!
Ohhh, never change, Hibari.

The New Year's gong rang, meaning THERES MORE PEOPLE THAT SURVIVED why am I even surprised, of course there is.

#image45
TEAMWORK AND FRIENDSHIP!
We shounen now.
